The ideal temperature, humidity, and rainfall conditions for crops like rice, maize, groundnut, and cotton in Bangalore can vary slightly depending on the specific variety of the crop. However, here are the general ideal conditions for these crops in Bangalore
1. Rice
Temperature: 25°C to 35°C
Rice generally requires warm temperatures to grow well, ideally between 25°C and 35°C.
Humidity: 70% to 85%
High humidity is favorable for rice cultivation as it thrives in moist environments.
Rainfall: 1000 mm to 1500 mm (annual rainfall)
Rice is a water-intensive crop and requires consistent and sufficient rainfall, especially during its growing season.
2. Maize (Corn)
Temperature: 20°C to 30°C
Maize grows best in moderate temperatures, with the ideal range being between 20°C and 30°C.
Humidity: 60% to 75%
Maize needs moderate humidity levels to prevent diseases while maintaining sufficient water in the soil.
Rainfall: 500 mm to 800 mm (annual rainfall)
Maize requires well-distributed rainfall, but it is relatively drought-tolerant compared to other crops like rice
3. Groundnut (Peanut)
Temperature: 25°C to 35°C
Groundnut grows well in warm climates, and temperatures between 25°C and 35°C are ideal.
Humidity: 50% to 60%
Groundnut is sensitive to excessive moisture, so moderate humidity levels (50-60%) are ideal.
Rainfall: 400 mm to 600 mm (annual rainfall)
Groundnut requires moderate rainfall, and it performs well in regions with a distinct dry season followed by moderate rains.
4. Cotton
Temperature: 25°C to 35°C
Cotton requires a warm climate with temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C.
Humidity: 50% to 60%
Cotton thrives in lower humidity, as excessive moisture can promote fungal diseases.
Rainfall: 500 mm to 800 mm (annual rainfall)
Cotton is relatively drought-tolerant, but consistent rainfall during the growing period is beneficial for higher yields.
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                      Summary Table of Ideal Conditions for Crops in Bangalore
Crop	Temperature (°C)	Humidity (%)	Rainfall (mm)
Rice	25°C to 35°C	70% to 85%	1000 mm to 1500 mm
Maize	20°C to 30°C	60% to 75%	500 mm to 800 mm
Groundnut	25°C to 35°C	50% to 60%	400 mm to 600 mm
Cotton	25°C to 35°C	50% to 60%	500 mm to 800 mm
These ranges are ideal for crop growth. Variations outside these ranges (such as extreme temperatures, humidity levels, or rainfall) can affect crop yields or even damage the crops. Therefore, understanding and monitoring these conditions can help farmers in Bangalore optimize their crop production.
